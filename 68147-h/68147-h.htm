<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>Dining-room of the</i> <span class="smcap">Clarks</span>, <i>cosily furnished in
dark; dining-table in center, two chairs at opposite ends,
table set with plates, knives, forks, spoons, glasses, coffee pot
and cups at right end, with sugar and a cream-pitcher;
plate, knife, fork, spoons, glass at left end; also a carafe
of water; butter, salt and pepper boxes, napkins, etc. A
sideboard with silver. Rug under table. Modern hanging
lamp over it. Doors at right and left. Window at back
beside sideboard. Telephone on small table in left corner.</i>
<span class="smcap">Mr. Clark</span>, <i>about 40 years of age, stout and easy going,
seated in chair at left end of table</i>. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Clark</span>, <i>about 35
years old, rather slim and nervous, at the right end. As the
curtain rises both are eating some meat and potatoes, a clock
in hall behind door at right striking the hour of eight.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Clark</span> (<i>raising her napkin to her mouth</i>). I wish
you wouldn’t say “it don’t,” John. That isn’t grammatical!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Clark</span> (<i>raising a piece of potato on his knife to his
mouth</i>). It ain’t—why isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>dropping her napkin to the floor, in a voice of
utter horror</i>). Oh, John, John! How many, <i>many</i> times
have I besought you not to use that terrible, <i>terrible</i> word
“ain’t”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>very cheerfully, raising another piece of potato
on his knife</i>). I dunno, Martha. I never was much good
at mental arithmetic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>picking up her napkin, mournfully</i>). John,
don’t you remember that you <i>promised</i> me when we were
engaged never more to utter that abominable word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>cutting awkwardly at his meat</i>). I <i>ain’t</i> quite
sure that I made such a promise, Martha.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>sharply</i>). John Clark, you <i>certainly</i> did make
such a promise—not once but <i>several</i> times!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>starting to raise a piece of meat to his mouth,
letting it fall</i>). But, Martha, that was <i>only</i> an engagement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
promise, and engagement promises <i>ain’t</i> no wise binding,
so to speak, after the wedding march is ended.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>angrily, again dropping her napkin</i>). Mr.
Clark, if you utter that word <i>again</i> I shall withdraw from
the table!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>still cutting away awkwardly at the meat</i>). All
right, Martha. I won’t use that word no more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>picking up her napkin, sharply</i>). John Clark,
what you have just said is also ungrammatical. It is <i>very</i>
incorrect for you to say “I won’t use that word no more.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>raising another piece of potato on his knife</i>).
But, my dear, I don’t see <i>why</i> it is incorrect for me to say
that I won’t use the word “ain’t” again. <i>Now</i> you’re blaming
me for <i>not</i> using it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>a little confused</i>). You know <i>very</i> well what I
mean! (<i>Suddenly and more sharply.</i>) John, how many
times have I requested you not to <i>eat</i> with your knife?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>letting his knife fall out of his hand to the
floor</i>). But what is a knife for if it isn’t to eat with?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>in tone of utter disgust</i>). Oh, won’t you <i>ever</i>
speak correct English. Why <i>couldn’t</i> you have said, “What
is the purpose of a table-knife if it is not to use in eating?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>very cordially, reaching down to pick up the
fallen knife</i>). You are <i>exactly</i> right, my dear. I agree
wholly with you—the purpose of a table-knife is to be used
in eating.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>very sharply</i>). But a table-knife is <i>not</i> a
freight elevator, John Clark!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>starting to raise more potato on his knife</i>).
No, Martha, a fork is the proper instrument with which
to convey a piece of meat from one’s plate to one’s mouth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>rising hastily, speaking quickly</i>). John, <i>stop</i>
that! <i>Never</i> use a knife, even at home, that has fallen to
the floor! (<i>Goes to the sideboard, opens a drawer, takes
out a table-knife and exchanges this knife for the one just
dropped by</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span>) There! (<i>Resuming her seat.</i>) Don’t
you <i>dare</i> to misuse <i>this</i> knife as you misused the other one,
John Clark!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>rather humbly</i>). No, ma’am! Still, it’s ever so
much easier to eat with my knife than with my fork.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>decidedly, beginning to eat again</i>). No, it isn’t!
Besides, it’s <i>very</i> vulgar—and dangerous, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>now using his fork</i>). Yet I’ve read somewhere—I
know I have—that George Washington ate with his
knife in the same way that I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>quickly</i>). Oh, well, forks were not invented
then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>drinking from his glass of water</i>). They never
should have been invented. Fingers are ever so much better
than forks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>rising from her seat to go again to the sideboard</i>).
I expected you to say that fingers were invented
before forks. How <i>did</i> it happen that you forgot to make
that remark—again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>using his napkin very clumsily</i>). Really I can’t
see why an honest hungry man should be ashamed of eating
with his knife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>returning to her seat with the sugar tongs</i>).
Well, it’s not the correct thing socially. Mrs. James’s husband
<i>never</i> eats with <i>his</i> knife. (<i>Quickly.</i>) John, that isn’t
a wash towel; it’s a napkin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>dropping the napkin to the floor</i>). I wish that
Mrs. James’s husband would pay that $100 he has owed
me for a year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>beginning to pour out the coffee</i>). You should
feel proud that a gentleman of <i>such</i> high social position as
Mr. James owes you a hundred dollars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>picking up the napkin</i>). Well, when a dozen
other gentlemen of high social position have each owed me
a hundred dollars for more than a year I don’t feel so
proud of Mr. James’s owing me a hundred plunks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>beginning to put in some sugar with the tongs
into the cup of coffee</i>). Not a hundred <i>plunks</i>, dear. You
mean a hundred <i>dollars</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>a little crossly</i>). I mean <i>just</i> what I say—a hundred
<i>plunks</i>! Perhaps if he ate with his knife and said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
“ain’t” the way I do he would never have borrowed them
hundred plunks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>in utter horror</i>). “<i>Them</i> hundred plunks!”
Oh, John!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>angrily</i>). Ye-es, <i>them hundred “bucks”</i>!
(<i>More angrily.</i>) Now, see here, Martha Smith, I am a <i>ve</i>-ry
<i>patient</i> man. My father was a patient man and my mother
was the most patientest woman you ever did see; but they
have had their limits, and so have I. (<i>Bringing his hand
down firmly upon the table.</i>) And when I get <i>real</i> riled
I ain’t nearly as agreeable as aforetimes. (<i>Pauses for a
moment as though to emphasise his remarks.</i>) As I said,
I am a ve-ry <i>patient</i> man, but I have my limit. Now,
Martha Smith, you have been a-pestering me all breakfast
time, and a-correcting me on my expressions of speech.
Also, you have been fault-finding with my table manners,
and I have got <i>ve</i>-ry tired of it. Now, I want you to understand,
Martha Smith, right <i>here</i>, that I won’t tolerate another
word from you (<i>he rises and then bangs his fist hard
upon the table</i>), and I’ll say “it ain’t,” “it hain’t,” “it don’t”
as often as I <i>darn</i> please! And I’ll eat with my knife or my
fingers as often as I <i>darn</i> please! (<i>Raising his voice still
more.</i>) Do you understand <i>that</i>, Martha Smith? (<i>He
glares angrily at her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>very coolly and very deliberately</i>). Mr. Clark,
you are <i>so</i> amusing when you get “real riled.” If you could
only <i>see yourself</i> (<i>mimics him</i>) “when you ain’t nearly as
agreeable as aforetimes.” Now, I <i>never</i> get angry myself,
<i>never</i>. And at any rate not after seeing you in a tantrum.
It’s too disgusting. You are <i>not</i> a handsome man, even
when you are <i>agreeable</i>, Mr. Clark; but when you are really
“riled,” <i>my!</i> you’re <i>homely</i>, as homely as—well, words <i>fail</i>
me! (<i>She laughs somewhat irritatingly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>walking furiously up and down the left side of
the room, savagely</i>). If you only was a man for a minute!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>more coolly and deliberately</i>). I wish I were
for only <i>half</i> a minute.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>walking more furiously, speaking more savagely</i>).
It is no wonder your <i>first</i> husband died!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>rising quickly from her chair</i>). What do you
<i>mean</i>, Mr. Clark? (<i>Then she reseats herself just as quickly.</i>)
No, I never get angry myself, <i>never</i>, and I’m <i>not</i> going to
become angry this time. (<i>She rises again and carries the
cup of coffee she has poured out, placing it at his end of
the table.</i>) You see how <i>calm</i> I am, Mr. Clark—how <i>very</i>
calm. (<i>She returns to her seat with a martyr-like smile.</i>)
If I were you I should drink that coffee before it gets cool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>pausing in his walking angrily</i>). I don’t <i>want</i>
any coffee! (<i>More angrily.</i>) Martha Smith, I asked you
if <i>you</i> understood?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>with great dignity</i>). Mr. Clark, please remember
that I am Mrs. Clark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>in a lower tone</i>). Guess I’ll never forget <i>that</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>beginning to pour out some coffee for herself</i>).
Don’t you think you had better drink your coffee? It must
be getting cool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>with a flash of anger</i>). Oh, <i>darn</i> the coffee!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>putting in two lumps of sugar</i>). Just as you
please, Mr. Clark, just as you <i>please</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>sitting down sulkily in his seat</i>). Martha Smith,
this <i>nagging</i> of yours is getting on my nerves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>pouring from the cream-pitcher into her coffee</i>).
I remarked a short while ago that I am <i>Mrs. Clark</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>settling down into his chair</i>). Well, because you
are Mrs. Clark doesn’t give you any right to nag me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>stirring her coffee</i>). I am <i>not</i> nagging you. I
have <i>never</i> nagged anybody in my life, but when you said
“them hundred plunks”—oh, horrors!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>beginning to finger his coffee spoon</i>). But what
<i>should</i> I have said?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>still stirring her coffee</i>). What <i>should</i> you have
said? Why—why—“those hundred dollars,” of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>in a grumbling tone</i>). It’s too blamed bad that
a man can’t speak as he wants to in his own home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>sipping her coffee</i>). You <i>may</i>, John, providing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
that you follow the rules of grammatical English, as are
observed by our best society.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>less sulkily, still fingering his coffee spoon</i>).
What do you mean by our best society, Martha?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>a little perplexed</i>). Our best society? Oh—yes—er—why,
our best society means those that are <i>in</i> the best
society—those who are the recognized leaders of society—the
men and women who are socially “it.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>quickly</i>). Martha! “Socially it”? I <i>am</i> surprised
to hear such an expression fall from your lips. “Socially
<i>it</i>”! Why, <i>what</i> a vulgar phrase. You <i>should</i> have
said, “Our best society consists of those men and women
who are the leaders of <i>élite</i> society!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>with much dignity</i>). Your coffee <i>must</i> be cold
by this time, John. Let me give you another cup?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>rather gleefully</i>). No, Martha, this coffee is all
right; but haven’t you forgotten something?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>still with dignity</i>). What is it I have forgotten?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>cheerfully</i>). The milk, Martha, the <i>milk</i>. Please
pass the milk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>reprovingly</i>). Of course you mean the <i>cream</i>,
John. (<i>Passing the pitcher.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>receiving the pitcher</i>). No, I mean the <i>milk</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>rather sharply</i>). But, my dear, it isn’t milk;
it’s <i>cream</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>obstinately</i>). It is <i>not</i>! It’s <i>milk</i>. (<i>Spelling it.</i>)
M-i-l-k, <i>milk</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>stirring her coffee</i>). It is not <i>milk</i>, John. Milk
is what the cows give—this is <i>cream</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>with a grin, still holding the pitcher</i>). I never
knew before that cream does not come from milk. <i>Very</i>
remarkable!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>a little confused</i>). Now don’t try to misunderstand
me. Of course milk comes from cream, and that
pitcher contains cream, <i>not</i> milk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>with another grin</i>). Martha, I never knew before
that milk comes from cream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>with dignity</i>). That was a slip of my tongue.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>gleefully</i>). Yes, just as when you say that this
pitcher contains cream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>sharply</i>). It <i>does</i> contain cream, and <i>not</i> milk!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>pouring some of it from the pitcher into a glass</i>).
Now, see <i>there</i>. Do you call <i>that</i> cream? <i>Cream!</i> It’s more
like skim milk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>wearily</i>). Can’t you comprehend, John? <i>Socially</i>
it is cream. You never ask for milk in your coffee
but always for cream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>impatiently</i>). I don’t care one continental what
it is socially. <i>Practically</i> it is milk. (<i>Drinking from the
glass into which he has poured from the pitcher.</i>) <span class="smcap">Yes</span>,
that’s <i>milk</i> all right. (<i>Pushing the pitcher towards</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span>)
Taste it yourself Martha. See if it isn’t milk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>nervously sipping her coffee</i>). That isn’t the
point at all. Of course when it’s in a drinking glass it <i>may</i>
be milk, but when it’s in a cream-pitcher it is <i>always</i> cream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>still more impatiently</i>). But pouring it into a
drinking glass doesn’t change its <i>real</i> nature. If it’s milk,
it’s milk, and if it’s cream, it’s <i>cream</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>again sipping her coffee</i>). Yes, it is <i>just</i> the
same in the pitcher as it is in the glass, only we call it,
politely, cream when it is in the pitcher and milk when in
the glass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>crossly</i>). Well, what has politeness to do with
it, anyway? If it’s milk in the glass it will be milk when
it’s in the pitcher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>sipping her coffee with a half smile</i>). Don’t
you <i>see</i>, John, that it’s cream when it’s in the cream-pitcher?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>still more crossly</i>). I suppose that if that pitcher
contained only water it could be called cream!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>putting down her spoon and drinking her
coffee</i>). You are <i>aw</i>-fully stupid—when you want to be,
my dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>rising quickly and going over to the telephone</i>).
You needn’t take <i>my</i> word for it. We’ll have some one
else’s opinion. (<i>Takes down the receiver.</i>) Hello! Give me
Main 203. (<i>Turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span>) I’m going to talk with Joe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
Williams. He’s head of the Wholesale Milk Company.
(<i>Speaking into ’phone.</i>) Hello! Is this Joe? I’m John
Clark. You see, Joe, my wife and I have had a slight dispute.
She declares up and down that the milk we are
using on our breakfast table is cream, and not milk at all.
I say that it’s <i>milk</i>—no matter whether it’s in a cream-pitcher
or not. She says that as long as it’s in a cream-pitcher
it’s cream and <i>not</i> milk. Now, Joe, am I <i>right</i>?
It’s milk, because I have drunk some of it and I remember
that Mrs. Clark told me this morning the milkman had
forgotten to leave the cream. (<i>Pauses a moment.</i>) What’s
<i>that</i>? You <i>think</i> I am right, but you are going to ask your
wife and will call me up soon? Thank <i>you</i>, Joe. (<i>He
replaces the receiver and returns to his chair.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>with a sweet smile</i>). I am sorry, John, that
you have had to call for assistance, but Mrs. Williams will,
I am sure, wholly agree with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>sourly</i>). Well, I was brought up on a farm
and I ought to know the difference between milk and cream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>with a very sweet smile</i>). I guess you were
brought up on a farm all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>angrily</i>). So were <i>you</i>! I found it out only a
short time ago. (<i>Laughing softly.</i>) Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>mimicking him</i>). Ha! ha! ha! <i>ha!</i> Now, I’m
<i>not</i> going to lose my temper, whatever you may say. I
<i>never</i> get angry myself—no, <i>never</i>!</p>

<p class="center">(<i>The telephone rings.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>hastening to the telephone</i>). <i>Now</i> we shall see!
(<i>Takes down the receiver.</i>) Hello! Hello, Joe. Oh, good
morning, Mrs. Williams. How do you do? Yes, thank you,
both my wife and I are pretty well. <i>What</i> did you say?
(<i>Listens while she is speaking.</i>) Is that so? It is? I understand.
<i>What</i> did you say? Oh, of course <i>socially</i>—yes—yes!
No, our dispute is not serious; only a difference of
opinion. As I told your husband a very <i>slight</i> difference.
<i>Thank</i> you for your trouble, Mrs. Williams. Will you
please ask Mr. Williams to come to the telephone a moment?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
O! He has gone for the day? Thank <i>you</i>—good-<i>bye</i>.
(<i>Impatiently hangs up the receiver.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>laughing heartily</i>). Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!
<i>ha!</i> What did I tell you, John? Didn’t Mrs. Williams agree
<i>wholly</i> with me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>reseating himself</i>). Yes, of <i>course</i> she did. I
expected <i>that</i>, but Joe, I’m sure, believes that I am <i>right</i>.
You see he didn’t <i>dare</i> to tell me his real opinion when his
wife was there. Probably he will visit us a little later and
convince you that you are wrong. But he didn’t have the
courage to say so in the presence of his wife. Isn’t it <i>too</i>
bad, Martha, that Joe hasn’t some of <i>my</i> independence?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>a little angrily</i>). I hope that Mr. Williams is
not as stupid as you are—<i>sometimes</i>. (<i>More angrily.</i>)
John, how <i>very</i> obstinate you are! You know well enough
that <i>I</i> have the right of it, and yet you won’t admit it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>slowly stirring his coffee</i>). After all, Martha,
I think I’ll have some coffee. Will you please pass me the
milk?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>with considerable temper</i>). John Clark, I
<i>never</i> get angry myself, <i>never</i>, but certainly you do try my
patience—sorely. Now, I don’t want you to call that cream
milk—<i>again</i>! <i>Not again!</i> (<i>She rises from her chair.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>still stirring his coffee</i>). Martha, will you please
pass me the—milk?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>angrily stamping her foot</i>). John Clark, how
<i>dare</i> you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>calmly</i>). Martha, will you <i>please</i> pass me the
milk!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>in a furious temper, stamping her foot and
then pounding upon the table</i>). It <i>ain’t</i> milk—it <i>ain’t</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>with mock seriousness</i>). <i>Martha!</i> It <i>ain’t</i>!
That is <i>not</i> grammatical. Oh, that terrible, <i>terrible</i> word—<i>ain’t</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>very furiously</i>). I never said ain’t—never—<i>never</i>—<i>never</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>very mournfully</i>). You did, Martha—you <i>did</i>.
I heard you. You said, “<i>It ain’t no milk!</i>”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>wildly seizing the cream-pitcher and suddenly
dashing it and its contents to the floor, in view of the audience</i>).
<i>There—darn it!</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>rising quickly</i>). Hold on! That is Grandmother
Smith’s old cream-pitcher!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>in despair</i>). Oh, <i>what</i> have I done! (<i>She
stands for a moment, looking silently at the ruins of the
prized cream-pitcher, and then sinks into her chair, pulling
out her handkerchief and weeping hysterically.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>standing as though dazed, gazing upon the shattered
pitcher.</i>) Gee <i>whiz</i>! (<i>Taking a step forward towards</i>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span>, <i>speaking kindly, placing his right hand gently upon
her shaking shoulders</i>.) Well, Martha, don’t feel so badly
about it—it ain’t any use to “cry over spilt milk!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>suddenly rising from her chair, glaring at</i> <span class="smcap">Mr.

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
